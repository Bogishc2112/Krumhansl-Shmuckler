# Krumhansl-Shmuckler
Implementation of song key detection algorithm as described in the paper "What's Key for Key? The Krumhansl-Schmuckler
Key-Finding Algorithm Reconsidered" by David Temperley, Ohio State University. Current accuracy for prediction with allowed margin of error within 1 neighbouring key class is 60%.
Current goals: create a large dataset of songs sorted by genres and estimate possible key-profiles based on the genre to imporve accuracy.
